# The *_globals_set.tcl file is sourced by only the upper most level
#   TCL code (usually *_startup.tcl) so values are set to the global
#   variables only once.  In *_globals_set.tcl file, the trace command
#   can be used to force the update of gui variables, colors, buttons,
#   etc on all gui panels.
